### Game of 90's

A 90's kid must be familiar with the game shown above and yes i just created the sub section of that game in **Java.**


**Inshort,**

This game covers only a small section instead of a complete journey of the character. The Interface has basic controls like moving forward, backward, and jump. It also includes a specific *set of rewards* for players along with a *bunch of enemies*.


***The code for the same is present at Github. Check the same from this [link](https://github.com/manishekaneja/Island-Game)***
