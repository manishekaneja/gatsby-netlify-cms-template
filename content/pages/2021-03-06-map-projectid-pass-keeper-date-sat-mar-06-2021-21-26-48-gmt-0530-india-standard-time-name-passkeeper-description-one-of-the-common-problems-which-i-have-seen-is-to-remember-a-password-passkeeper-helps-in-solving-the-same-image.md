### Remembering multiple passwords can be really hectic



Yes, the best possible solution to that (which comes to almost everyone's minds ) is "Let's write it somewhere". **But is it safe??**. I don't want to expose any of my passwords by just writing them on a piece of paper.

The next immediate option is to keep it on Mobile. But generally, it's difficult to organize passwords on mobile notepads or text files.

\*PassKeeper solves the exact same issue\*. Providing a card interface to same and manage Different Accounts and their credentials.

In short, the focus of the application is to:

* Provide a better way to organize accounts
* No Internet Required (100% offline)
* Support Local Encryption
* Default Hide Feature (No tension of some seeing your password accidently)
