### For Every *Developer* having a portfolio is an essential.


That's what I think. So I did the same, created a web portfolio to share the following points:

* *What I actually do.*

* *What technologies I have worked on.*

* *Kind of projects I have made till now.*

So I end up making a portfolio with a simple but nice-looking design. Tried giving a consistent theme to the whole application.

The special part of this side project of mine is, I have used [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/) for the first time in this. The only purpose for using [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/) was to build an information-representing-webpage and not an Application. And being a fan of  [React](https://reactjs.org/), Gatsby seems to be a perfect choice. *(And of course, I really wanted to give Gatsby a try).*
